# Project Title: HTML Elements Reference Guide
---
Create a webpage that serves as both a reference guide for HTML elements and as a demonstration of those elements in action.

This can be used to practice your HTML knowledge and to see how different elements are rendered in a browser.

The entire website should be built using HTML only

---
## Basic structure
1. Basic page structure with `<!DOCTYPE html>`, `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>` tags.

2. Document sections `<header>` , `<main>` and `<footer>`
3. Text content elements such as headings, paragraphs, blockquotes, pre and code, thematic breaks, line breaks, lists and all other text content elements
4. Links and navigation elements such as `<a>`, `<nav>`, and `<ul>` or `<ol>` for navigation menus.
5. Media elements
6. Tables
7. Forms and input elements
8. semantic elements like `<article>`, `<section>`, `<aside>`, and `<figure>`.
9. Interactive elements like buttons and details/summary elements.
10. Metadata elements like `<base>` `<title>`, `<meta>`, and `<link>`.

## Learning approach
1. Build the page section by section, starting with the basic structure and then adding more complex elements.
2. For each element research:
  - Its purpose and usage
  - Required and optional attributes
  - Accessibility considerations
3. Validate the HTML using a validator tool to ensure it meets standards.(use the (https://validator.w3.org/detailed.html)[W3C validator])
